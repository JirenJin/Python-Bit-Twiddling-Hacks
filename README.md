# Python-Bit-Twiddling-Hacks
A Python implemention of ["Bit Twiddling Hacks"](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html), which is originally collected and described by Sean Eron Anderson. I made this for improving my bit manipulation skills, but I would also be glad if you find it useful for whatever reasons :-)
